   Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that separates the software into distinct layers and components based on their responsibility and the degree of coupling between them. It was introduced by Robert Martin and aims to make the code more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

The basic idea behind Clean Architecture is to have a clear separation of concerns between the different parts of the system, with the highest-level components having no direct knowledge of the lower-level components. The architecture consists of the following layers, starting from the innermost:

Entities - This layer contains the core business objects and entities of the system, independent of any specific use case.

Use Cases - This layer contains the application-specific business rules and logic, using the entities defined in the previous layer.

Interface Adapters - This layer adapts the use cases to the specific interface requirements of the user, such as a web application or mobile app. It includes things like controllers, view models, and presentation models.

Frameworks and Drivers - This layer contains the infrastructure and tools that the system is built upon, such as a database, web server, or operating system.

In Clean Architecture, the dependencies between the layers always point inwards, towards the center. This means that the innermost layer can change without affecting the outer layers, allowing for a high degree of modularity and testability.

By separating the components and layers in this way, Clean Architecture makes it easier to maintain and extend the software over time, as changes in one part of the system do not affect the others. Additionally, the clear separation of concerns helps to make the code more understandable and less prone to bugs.

This diagram shows the four main layers of Clean Architecture, starting from the outermost layer (Frameworks and Drivers) and moving inward to the innermost layer (Entities). The arrows indicate the direction of the dependencies between the layers, with the dependencies always pointing inward towards the center.

It's important to note that the exact composition of each layer will vary depending on the specific requirements of the project, and the diagram is intended to provide a general understanding of the architecture, not a specific implementation.
